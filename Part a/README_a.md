# ChemistryExperiments - Part (a)

This repository contains a Python script for setting up and conducting high-throughput chemistry experiments, specifically focusing on cross-coupling reactions.

## Files

- `chemistry_a.py`: Contains the experimental design for 12 cross-coupling reactions.
- `experimental_design_a.csv`: The CSV file generated by the script containing the detailed experimental design.

## Experimental Design

The script sets up an experimental design for 12 cross-coupling reactions of the form:

\[ \text{A}_i + \text{B}_i \rightarrow \text{C}_i \]

where A and B are starting materials, and C is the product. The following conditions are used:

- **Limiting reagent (A):** 0.1 mmol
- **B:** 1.1 equivalents relative to A
- **Pd(OAc)2:** 10 mol% relative to A
- **Ligand:** 15 mol% relative to A
- **Total reaction volume:** 200 uL
- **96 well plates with a maximum volume of 500 uL

### Conditions Screened

- **Temperatures:** 60°C and 80°C
- **Solvents:** Toluene, glyme, TBME, and dichloroethane
- **Ligands:** XPhos, SPhos, and dppf

## Usage

To generate the experimental design and visualize the distribution of experimental conditions, run the `chemistry_a.py` script. The script will create an `experimental_design_a.csv` file and a plot showing the experimental conditions.

### Example

```bash
python chemistry_a.py
